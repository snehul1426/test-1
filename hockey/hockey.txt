Stick: Choose a stick made from durable materials like carbon fiber composite or wood laminate. The type of stick depends on whether you play offense or defense.

Skates: Quality skates are critical for agility. Ensure they fit comfortably without being too tight or loose. You should be able to wiggle your toes while standing up straight.

Helmet: A helmet with a faceguard is crucial for protecting against serious injury. Make sure it’s securely fitted and approved by the Hockey Equipment Certification Council (HECC).

Gloves: Snug-fitting gloves protect your hands from falls and fast-moving pucks. Look for reinforced palms and ample padding along knuckles and fingers.

Shoulder Pads: These protect the upper body. Ensure they fit well and don’t slip during play.

Elbow Pads: Cushioning for impacts during falls or collisions with opponents.

Mouthguard: Reduces the risk of mouth and teeth injuries.

Shin Guards: Essential for protecting your shins from sticks and pucks.

Jock/Cup: Athletic protector for groin safety.

Hockey Pants: Provide additional padding for the hips and thighs.
