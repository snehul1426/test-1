Football Ball: The soccer ball is the most crucial piece of equipment. Itâ€™s typically made of leather, filled with air, and has a round shape.

Uniform & Kit:

	Jersey: Players wear numbered jerseys.

	Shorts: A pair of shorts completes the outfit.

	Long Socks: These cover and secure the shin guards to the lower leg.

Shin Guards: Protective pads worn on the lower legs to prevent injuries during tackles and collisions.

Shoes (Cleats): Football-specific shoes with studs or spikes provide traction on the field. They vary based on the playing surface 
(grass, turf, or indoor) and player position.

Gloves (For Goalkeepers): Goalkeepers wear gloves with extra padding and grip to catch and throw the ball.
